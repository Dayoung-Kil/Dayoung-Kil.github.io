I am Dayoung, a Ph.D. student at the Graduate School of Soongsil University, conducting my research under the supervision of Professor Seong Heum Kim in the Visual Intelligence and Platform (VIP) Lab. My research primarily focuses on hardware-efficient artificial intelligence, with particular emphasis on Efficient Deep Learning, Pruning, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), and Multimodal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs). 
Recently, I have been actively exploring LVLMs and advanced token pruning techniques to enhance the efficiency and performance of large-scale multimodal systems.
